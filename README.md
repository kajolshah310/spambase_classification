# Spambase Classification

## Description
This repository focuses on classifying emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using a fully connected neural network implemented with Keras. The objective is to develop a classification model that can accurately identify spam emails based on various features extracted from the email content.

The dataset used for this project is the Spambase dataset, which contains a collection of features extracted from spam and non-spam emails. By training a neural network on this dataset, we aim to learn the patterns and characteristics that distinguish spam emails from legitimate ones and make accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Spambase dataset. It consists of 4,601 instances, where each instance represents an email. The dataset contains a set of attributes (features) such as the frequency of certain words, characters, and other characteristics found in the email. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the email is spam (1) or not (0).

The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure compatibility with the neural network model.

## Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
2. Implementation of a fully connected neural network using Keras, a high-level deep learning library.
3. Model training and evaluation using the training set, followed by testing on the unseen test set.
4. Analysis of model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Usage
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/spambase_classification.git
```
2) Open the spambase_classification.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible IDE.

3) Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the notebook, if necessary.

4) Execute the code and follow along with the implementation of the email spam classification model.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different neural network architectures or hyperparameters, or explore additional techniques to improve the classification accuracy.
